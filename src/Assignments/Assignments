1. Movement:
	* Make the robot move forward for 3 seconds and stop.
	
	* Make the robot spin around the center.
	
	* Make the robot spin around one wheel.
	
	* Make the robot move in a figure 8 pattern.
	
2. Bump Sensors:
	* Start the robot moving forward. When it is bumped in the center,
	  make the robot reverse its direction.
	  
	* Make the robot follow a wall using the bump sensors
	  
	* Set up obstacles in a slalom pattern. Make the robot bounce off each obstacle using the bump sensors.

3. Light Sensors:
	* Make the robot follow along the wall without touching it
	
4. Distance Sensors:
	* Using a measuring device, figure out the unit of measurement that the getDistance() method uses.
	
	* Make the robot move exactly 3 feet and stop. **** DO NOT USE sleep(int) ****
	
5. Angle Sensors:
	* Make the robot spin exactly 90 degrees and stop. **** DO NOT USE sleep(int) ****
	
	* Make the robot go forward at full speed. Use the angle sensor to keep it in a strait line.

6. Distance and Angle Sensors:
	* Make the robot repeatedly move forward for exactly 1 foot, turn around 180 degrees, return to its original position, and turn another 180 degrees. 
	  **** DO NOT USE sleep(int) ****
	  
	
7. Sonar Sensors
	* Make the robot run away from any object detected by the sonar sensors

	* Use the light sensor to make the robot follow the wall without touching it. Use the sonar sensor to stop the robot when it reaches the doorway.
